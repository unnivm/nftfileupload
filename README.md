Simple demo for how to upload an image to IPFS using Moralis

This repo contains a simple demo that demonstrates how an image can be uploaded to IPFS using Moralis JavaScript SDK. 

Once the image is uploaded then it is available in IPFS ledger and the Moralis daashboard.

Before uploading an image, you need to create a wallet and have address. This can be done by adding metamask wallet firefox extension. You can use any such wallet provider.

This is the location of my image in IPFS:
